# IMDB
When we first learn machine learning, we have learnt to solve this problem with sklearn and logistic regression with softmax (multi-classes) or sigmond (binary-classes) as activation functions.

We'll use the IMDB dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are balanced, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
